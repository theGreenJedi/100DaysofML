## 100 Days Of ML - LOG
### Day 0 : July 8, 2018

**Thoughts:** As a ML hobbyist/tinkerer already, I find myself already devoting an hour a day on average. But this will give some structure to my explorations, and who knows? Maybe thru focusing, I will accomplish more. Fun.

**Today's Progress:** Initialized log repo - Crafted reply to subreddit.

### Day 1 :July 9, 2018

**Thoughts:** My ideas for project to tackle is still percolating. I am leaning towards something in biology. Read my daily ML blogs/vlogs etc, and going to wrap up with implementing a paper (Haven't found one yet - Maybe I will just read a bunch of papers today in search of one to emulate.

**Today's Progress:** After reading through papers for an hour, I settled on 5 that I want to truly study (included them in the repo)

### Day 0 (Again): Jan 1, 2019

**Update:** The New Year brings reflection on the past years accomplishments. A regret I have from 2018 is Not completing the 100 Days of ML. I feel as if I have done 300 days of ML yearly for the past few years - But I'd like to document for this fine program. So here we go (again:)

**Today's Progress:** Updated github.io - read thru arxiv/slack
