## 100 Days Of ML - LOG
### Day 0 : July 8, 2018

**Thoughts:** As a ML hobbyist/tinkerer already, I find myself already devoting an hour a day on average. But this will give some structure to my explorations, and who knows? Maybe thru focusing, I will accomplish more. Fun.

**Today's Progress:** Initialized log repo - Crafted reply to subreddit.
