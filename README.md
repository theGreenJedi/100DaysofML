100 Days Of ML - LOG
Day 0 : July 8, 2018

Thoughts : As a ML hobbyist/tinkerer already, I find myself already devoting an hour a day on average. But this will give some structure to my explorations, and who knows? Maybe thru focusing, I will accomplish more. Fun.

Today's Progress: Initialized log repo - Crafted reply to subreddit.

Links : 

Thoughts : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .
Day 1 : Jul 1 , 2018

Today's Progress : I have completed data preparation for kaggle ml problem .

Thoughts : It is really challenging and many error occured , but I have debuged them . It was really fun .

Link of Work: Commit
Day 2 : Jul 2 , 2018

Today's Progress : I have completed initial training and testing of the model and submitted to the Kaggle .

Thoughts : The score have to be improved I will try my best on it and it is really fun .

Day 3 : Jul 3 , 2018

Today's Progress : I have completed Google ML crash course upto reduce data loss .

Thoughts : The course is really good and it contain lots of good contents . It is good for a beginner .

Day 4 : Jul 4 , 2018

Thoughts : As a ML hobbyist/tinkerer, I find myself already devoting an hour a day on average. But this will give some structure to my explorations, and who knows? Maybe thru focusing, I will accomplish more. Fun.Today's Progress : I have done more of Google ML crash course .

Thoughts : The programing exercises are good.

Day 5 : Jul 5 , 2018

Today's Progress : I have implemented Linear regression model algorithm from scratch and used it to prediction .

Thoughts : The builtin tools or models we use are also just algorithms , they are not any rocket science , learning ML become more fun when these algorithms are implemented from scratch , it was really a great experience .

Day 6 : Jul 6 , 2018

Today's Progress : Learned about Gradient descent algorithm and its equations .

Thoughts : the concepts are really good .

Link of Work: Siraj's Gradient descent
Day 7 : Jul 7 , 2018

Today's Progress : Learned and Implemented Gradient descent algorithm, Stochastic grad descent, mini batch , polynomial .

Thoughts : the concepts are really good .

Day 8 : Jul 8 , 2018

Today's Progress : Learned and Implemented Learning curves .

Thoughts : learning curves are really helpful in determining a model is overfiting or underfiting .
